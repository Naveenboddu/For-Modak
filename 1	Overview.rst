Nabu converges data discovery, data ingestion, data preparation, data catalogue and data profiling into a single enterprise platform with metadata being primary driver. 
Metadata is captured and kept up to date via a suite of crawlers that gather and store technical metadata for each identified data asset. This metadata is utilized by BotWorks â€“ a framework comprising asynchronous, independent computing units chained together in dynamic flow patterns, to orchestrate various tasks in Nabu, such as data ingestion and data profiling. The data can be explored through Nabu search interface. Similar data is identified through data fingerprinting technology. 
Nabu 2.5 adds more self-service capabilities for regular data engineering activities and provides improved visibility on the progress/status of such activities
